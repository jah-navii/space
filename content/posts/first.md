As a start to this space where I'll be sharing bits and pieces of my life, I think its important to share what makes me me outside of being a student and participating in a race. I'm a reader and I love consuming content not just from books but also movies, articles etc. I love exploring more things to do and adding them to my hobby list. I'm not good at art but I love playing with colours. I also sing and play the guitar. 
You'll find me playing the newyorktimes games / linkedin games a little too often while also playing card games once in a while as a pasttime.
